# Are-Wins-A-Quarterback-Statistic

The primary focus of this project is to conduct an analysis of the relationship between a binary variable of
home wins and play by play statistical derivative variables for quarterbacks, running backs, wide receivers, and
potentially offensive lineman. The derivative statistical data for each position are divided into run plays and pass
plays and are broken down into pass length and pass location for pass plays or run gap and run location for run
plays. These derivative statistical data are further grouped for each specific quarterback_id, rusher_id, and
wide_receiver_id for each specific game_id based on the zone locations above. This analysis aims to provide value
insight into the world of professional football by investigating how play by play performance metrics for each
specific player correlate with home wins or home losses. 

This project focuses on using play by play NFL data from nflfastR for the 2023 season.
